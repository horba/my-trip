This is what the app looks like for unauthorized users. They can see the places where to eat (cafes, restaurants, etc.), places to sleep (hotels, etc), places where you can spend time (museums, palaces of culture, recreation, etc.). The '$' sign indicates how expensive the menu is in the restaurant. The search is performed by proximity.
