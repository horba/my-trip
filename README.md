This is what the app looks like for unauthorized users. They can see the places where to eat (cafes, restaurants, etc.), places to sleep (hotels, etc), places where you can spend time (museums, palaces of culture, recreation, etc.). The '$' sign indicates how expensive the menu is in the restaurant. The search is performed by proximity.
Also shown is the localization of the application. When you select a language, the app is instantly translated, without reloading the page.
Also, unauthorized users can log in, register, and restore their password using email
